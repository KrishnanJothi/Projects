## Semantic sentence pair similarity using SBERT

#### _This project aims to develop and test a machine-learning-based prototypical software assistant using state-of-the-art NLP models for terminology harmonization in Python._
  -   Data preparation -> Data cleaning, building sentence pairs, annotating the data, and avoiding imbalanced dataset
  -   Conduct experiments to understand the data better, gain insights, and to optimize its usage
  -   Selection of suitable pre-trained bi-encoder sentence-BERT model for pairwise sentence scoring tasks on the input dataset  
  -   Selection of the training strategy to fine-tune the pretrained model
  -   To overcome limited annotated dataset issues, knowledge is transferred from cross-encoders to bi-encoders using Augmented SBERT
